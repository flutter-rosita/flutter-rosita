# Flutter Rosita

An extension to the [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) for building Flutter applications for WEB.

_Flutter and the related logo are trademarks of Google LLC._

## Installation

- [Linux](doc/linux-install.md)
- [Windows](doc/windows-install.md)
- [macOS](doc/macos-install.md)

## Usage

`flutter-rosita` substitutes the original [`flutter`](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) CLI command. Only the command line interface is supported.

```sh
# Build the project and run WEB (either in debug or release mode).
flutter-rosita run
flutter-rosita run --release

# Build the project for WEB (release mode).
flutter-rosita build web
```

If you run into any problem, post an [issue](../../issues) in this repository to get help. If your issue is clearly not Rosita-specific (i.e. it's reproducible with the regular `flutter` command), you may file an issue in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues.
