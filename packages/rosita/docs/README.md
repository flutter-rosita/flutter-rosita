# Flutter Rosita

Flutter Rosita is a fork with changes to speed up WEB rendering.

It is worth trying Rosita if Flutter WEB html renderer is not fast enough for you, and if you are willing to make compromises to improve interface responsiveness.

## Usage
Install [Flutter Rosita](https://github.com/flutter-rosita/flutter-rosita#installation)
